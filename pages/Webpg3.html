 <h2>Parrot OS History</h2>

  <p>Parrot is a Debian based Linux operating system focused on Penetration Testing, Digial Forensics, Programming and Privacy protection
    . It was initially<a href="https://blog.parrotlinux.org/parrot-4-7-release-notes/"><strong> released on April 10th of 2013</strong></a>
       and has been improved since. Parrot uses a
    custom version of mate which is popularly installed on top of Debian based operating systems. The developers have themed Parrot
    with colorful images and icons. The terminal has been programmed with a unique design which takes advantage of vibrant colors and
    uses untraditional ASCII characters to make the bash shell look stunning. One notable feature
    is the anon surf menu, which contains toggles and programs for the anonymous mode and i2p services. When launching anonymous mode a
    window pops up asking if you want to “kill dangerous applications” and “clean some application caches”. Once the program finishes,
    all network traffic from parrot will automatically be routed through the tor network, including terminal applications. And if you
    want to change your IP, you can easily click change exit node in the Anon Surf menu. The Most
    Used Tools is a good place to start after installing Parrot as popular tools with great documentation are included here. Parrot
    has around 515 tools leaving users with plenty to use. Parrot also has powerful programming software. Among these are the Atom
    text editor, QT Creator, GNU Radio Companion, SQLite  Database browser and more. There are also plenty of tools for the typical
    user. Office applications are preinstalled, including LibreOffice. Also Firefox, mpv media player and VLC are preinstalled for
    web browsing and multi-media. Parrot is a great Operating System for Pen Testing and even every day use.</p>
