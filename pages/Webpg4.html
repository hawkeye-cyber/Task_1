 <h2>Black Arch Linux History</h2>

  <p>Another significant contender is Black Arch. Black Arch linux is a Pen Testing Linux distribution for pen testing and security
    researchers. With the Live DVD being 8.2 Gigabytes, there has too be a lot of tools preinstalled and luckily there are.
    There are <a href="https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html"><strong><em>2363</em></strong></a> tools in the repository making Black Arch the Number One contender for
    most tools. If there is a pen testing tool, your likely to find it on Black Arch. There are plenty of commandline and
    graphical tools to use including wireshark, ettercap, and too much more. There are a total of 51 categories of tools.
    BlackArch was initially released in 2014 which makes it the newest of the three. Many users may be deterred by BlackArchâ€™s
    User interface, as it does not contain an application search and is difficult to navigate through the small application list.
    Users that are used using the Linux terminal will most likely favor BlackArch as they will be most able to take advantage of
    the many tools included in Black Arch Linux.</p>
