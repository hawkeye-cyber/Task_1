 <h2>Kali Linux History</h2>

  <p>Kali Linux is a Pentestions OS. Today cyber security has become a significant topic regarding technology. In the Linux community Kali Linux
    is the number one operating system that is focused on Cyber Security. Kali Linux was initially released on March 13th of 2013. Kali based on
    BackTrack Linux which was first released on May 26th 2006 and was the dominant security Operating system prior to Kali Linux
    <a href="https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/"><strong>History</strong></a>. The last release
    of BackTrack Linux was on August 13th of 2012. Since the developers have decided to use Gnome as the desktop environment getting help from
    online will be easy and touch screens will be easily supported. With the user friendly desktop switcher, gnome terminal, and
    application menu getting
    into using Kali Linux will be a breeze. With over over 600
    penetration testing tools it is easy to find something to learn. Since Kali Linux is well known, support and education resources will be
    easily accessible to users.<em> The developers of Kali Linux</em> have create various editions so that it can run on a large range of devices.
    Kali NetHunter was developed as an Open Source Android penetration testing platform for Nexus devices. Also additional nethunter support
    for other mobile devices have been developed by the community. As Kali Linux has aged, new <em><strong>Cyber Security</strong></em>
      focused operating systems have
    risen in popularity which raises the question, has Kali Linux been overthrown as the top pen testing operating system?<br>Distros, that
    are made for every day use.</p>
